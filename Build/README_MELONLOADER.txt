Place the contents of this folder (except this readme file) in your I Am Your Beast game folder. Make sure you have Melonloader 5 Mono installed.

Be sure to run the game via Steam (do not click on the exe in the game folder)

To uninstall, remove the following
-beastboardsui from I Am Your Beast_Data/SteamingAssets folder
-BeastBoards.MelonLoader.dll from Mods
-Newtonsoft.Json.dll from UserLibs - it's possible, but unlikely that this may be required by other mods you have installed, so be careful here.
